            <h1>Handmade Soap examples (this area is in progress)</h1>
            <h3>All of our soaps are meticulously formulated through years of dedicated testing.</h3>
            <h3>These bars are crafted with a focus on quality and functionality, rather than extravagant embellishments. </h3>
            <h3>You wonâ€™t find unnecessary additives like multiple mica powders or abrasive dried flowers here.</h3>
            <h3>Instead, our soaps strike the perfect balance of hardness, lather, and suds,h3>
            <h3>delivering the exceptional cleanliness that a truly great soap should provide.</h3>
